                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>In recent years our understanding of infectious-disease epidemiology and control has been greatly increased through mathematical modelling. With infectious diseases frequently dominating news headlines, public health and pharmaceutical industry professionals, policy makers and infectious disease researchers increasingly need to understand the transmission patterns of infectious diseases. This allows them to interpret and critically evaluate both epidemiological data and the findings of mathematical modelling studies.</p>
                <p>The transmissible nature and resulting non-linear dynamics of infectious diseases make them fundamentally different from non-infectious diseases. As a result, techniques from 'classical' epidemiology are often invalid and are likely to lead to misleading conclusions.</p>
                <p>Over the last 30 years there has been rapid progress in developing models and techniques for the analysis of epidemic data. Those techniques have been applied to a variety of pathogens such as HIV, SARS, avian influenza, pandemic influenza, Ebola and malaria. The Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College London has been the world leader in mathematical modelling of the epidemiology and control of infectious diseases of humans and animals, for many years. Our department is actively engaged in research and regularly advises public health professionals, policy-makers, governments, international organisations and pharmaceutical companies, often during real-time outbreak situations.</p>
                <p>Our course has been taught since 1990 by leading researchers in infectious disease epidemiology, who provide a thorough, but accessible and demystifying introduction to the essential elements of modelling and an update of the most practically-relevant aspects of this fast-moving field. The course is revised every year to reflect the most recent developments in the field. Diseases covered include COVID-19, avian influenza, SARS, HIV, TB, Influenza A (H1N1), Ebola, malaria and other vector-borne diseases. Past participants have included hospital clinicians, public health executives, health economists, veterinary researchers, biologists, and mathematicians who have come from 42 countries.</p>

                    <h2>What is the required level of mathematical ability?</h2>
                    <p>Course participants require only a <strong>very basic mathematical ability</strong> (high school level is more than sufficient), as the fundamental principles of infectious-disease transmission behaviour are simple to grasp. Since most participants do not use maths regularly, if at all, we introduce concepts gently, step-by-step, and we offer the reassurance of an optional maths refresher on the Sunday before the course.</p>
                    <p>Course participants do not require any coding abilities. Calculation is done using Excel (With an optional Excel refresher day on the Sunday before the course) and a user-friendly modelling package. Hence manipulation of equations is not required, and participants are not expected to know any programing languages. </p>
                    <p>We emphasise how to express biological and clinical principles in a model and how to interpret results from a biological and clinical perspective.</p>

                    <p>While the key concepts are introduced in lectures, most of the learning takes place in computer practical sessions, question-and-answer sessions and small-group discussions of key topics and published papers. This interactive teaching is designed to encourage reflection and consolidation of the key concepts.</p>
                    <p>In the first week, the basic conceptual, mathematical, statistical and simple computational tools needed for a rigorous approach to infectious disease epidemiology are introduced. Keynote lectures and case studies covering a wide range of topics place the current use of mathematical modelling in context, illustrating how it contributes in a number of ways to epidemiological studies, policy-making and evaluation. </p>
                    <p>The focus of the second week is on extended, in-depth, hands-on, small-group projects, complemented by lectures addressing practical case studies.</p>

                    <p>We ask that all participants bring a laptop computer to allow them to fully engage with our user-friendly modelling software, along with all the models used and developed on the course.</p>
                    <p>The course also provides many opportunities to talk with department staff during numerous social events, including a dinner banquet and special buffet lunches. In the past those informal exchanges have lead to various scientific collaborations. </p>
